# Scarlett V0.2.5

Tested and is used on php 7.4 and MySQL 5.7 with both apache or IIS.

At the moment this is Alpha type software, do not use on a production enviroment that matters, 
STRONGLY suggest renaming the admin folder somthing different so anyone can't just edit stuff.


I need to work on my documentation skills...
Frankly need to rebuild the whole thing from scratch to remove the debug code and stuff...
